# Say something!

Hi there, I'm Phu! Love creating things (hopefully useful somehow, mostly useless lol).
Feel free to check out interesting projects or connect with me at my [GitHub](https://github.com/richeyphu) and [personal website](https://phurit.de)!

I'd also like to say thanks for organizing this event and connecting us. Look forward to participating in the future.
